## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this lab, you will be adding the ability to search through your grocery list to the toolbar, based on the name of the items. Your search must operate in one of two ways:

- Your search term can appear at the beginning of a word in the name
- Your search term can appear anywhere in the name (even in the middle of a word)

The grocery list table looks like this:
